# Exception Explainer

This is a reference tool for exceptions created by integereleven solutions. It aims to assist in resolving application issues by providing insight into exceptions and underlying causes.

> [!NOTE]
> Exception Explainer does no telemetry and tracks no data of any kind. It simply renders and make static inferences about the information sent to it.


> [!NOTE]
> This version of the Exception Explainer is extremely basic compared to what is in the pipeline. It consists of static content that currently does nothing with the sent exception data.
