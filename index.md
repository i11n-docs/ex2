# Exception Explainer

This is a reference tool for exceptions created by integereleven solutions. It aims to assist in resolving application issues by providing insight into exceptions and underlying causes.

> This version of the Exception Explainer is extremely basic compared to what is in the pipeline. It consists of static content that currently does nothing with the sent exception data. { .note }
